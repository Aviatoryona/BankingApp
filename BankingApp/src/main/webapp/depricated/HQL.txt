DATABASE

According to wikipedia a DATABASE is an organized collection of data, generally stored and
accessed electronically from a computer system.

SQL is a language to operate databases, it includes database creation, deletion, fetching
rows, modifying rows

Hibernate Query Language (HQL) and Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) are query languages that enable us to write SQL queries using Objects.

Both HQL and JPQL allow SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE.JPQL supports INSERT.

We can write named queries by using @NamedQuery annotation and we can wrap
several named queries like in an array like form using @NamedQueries annotation


The SELECT clause
The SELECT clause identifies which objects and values to return as the query results.
Java Persistence Query Language requruires a select clause.

The FROM clause defines the scope of object model type to implement in the Query, this model is usually the entity that was used to provide table columns and other
table manipulation attributes. Identification variable is an alias (u) of root entity reference which is the entity class name (User). Identitification variable is usually in lower case.


The WHERE clause of a query is made up of predicates which assert whether values in each potential row match the current criteria.
It restricts the results returned from a select query and limits the scope of update and delete queries.

joins
We can use join keyword in line with FROM clause to define explicit relationship joins.
This enables us to combine records from two or more tables in a database by using values common to each.

Distinct
We can use DISTINCT  to remove duplicates from a result set

Example of distint is retrieving non repeative ids for customers that have made an order
in one month despite many orders made by a single customer.


HQL and JPQL also support aggregate functions ie built-in functions like avg(), sum(), count(), MAX, MIN..
to perform what is known as the aggregate data calculations against a table or a specific table column.

The SQL GROUP BY clause is used in collaboration with the SELECT statement to arrange
identical data into groups. This GROUP BY clause follows the WHERE clause in a SELECT
statement and precedes the ORDER BY clause.
