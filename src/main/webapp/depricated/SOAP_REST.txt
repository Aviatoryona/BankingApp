SOAP AND REST
We are living in a computer era where computers have change the way we live.
Since the development of the web, there was need to communicate and share resources over the internet.
The HyperText Trasfer protocol defined a request-response protocol in the client-server computing model.

We can use both SOAP and REST for data communication between devices but the major difference is the architectural 
style used by clients to access web services ie calls,and serialization. 

A web service is an application component published and used on the web. The main purpose of web services is to make 
reusable application components and to connect existing  software.

SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol) is a standard messaging protocol for exchanging data among computers.
It is an XML based protocol for accessing web services and XML messaging over HTTP. The use of XML 
makes it language and platform independent.

Given the WSDL(Web Service Description Language) ie XML based language for describing web services, 
we can create a web service. We can then use JAXB to marshall objects and unmarshall a SOAP message.

A SOAP message is the XML document instance carried as payload over other network protocol.

SOAP has its own XML schema, namespaces and processsing rules. A SOAP message markup has envelop, header and body
elements.
The envelop element defines the start and end of the message.


REST (REprentational State Transfer) is an architecture for the web that uses HTTP protocol 
using defined HTTP methods, GET,POST, PUT ,DELETE for data communication  using a unique 
URI  over the internet.
Unlike SOAP, REST uses both XML and JSON (Javascript Object Notation) document formats to transfer and receive data.
REST provides an easier way to consume API built using JAX-RS.
